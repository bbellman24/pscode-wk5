// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

num1 = odd or even
print odd or even

ask for 1 number input
determine if number = odd or even
print on the screen the result

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(a + b + c + d + e)/5 = avg
(num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5)/5 = average

ask for 5 numbers
add the 5 numbers together and divide the sum by 5
determine the highest and lowest number in the set
print on the screen the average
print on the screen the highest and lowest number
